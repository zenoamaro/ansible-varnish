Varnish for Ansible
===================

A role for deploying and configuring [Varnish](http://varnish.com/) and extensions on unix hosts using [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/).

It can additionally be used as a playbook for quickly provisioning hosts.

Vagrant machines are provided to produce a boxed install of Varnish or a VM for integration testing.


Supports
--------
Supported Varnish versions:
- Varnish 3.x

Supported targets:
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trusty Tahr"
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS "Precise Pangolin"
- Debian (untested)

Installation methods:

- Binary packages from the official repositories at [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/repo)

Callable tasks:

- `vcl`: Creates (or removes) a Varnish VCL configuration


Usage
-----
Clone this repo into your roles directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/zenoamaro/ansible-varnish.git roles/varnish

And add it to your play's roles:

    - hosts: ...
      roles:
        - varnish
        - ...

This roles comes preloaded with almost every available default. You can override each one in your hosts/group vars, in your inventory, or in your play. See the annotated defaults in `defaults/main.yml` for help in configuration. All provided variables start with `varnish_`.

You can also use the role as a playbook. You will be asked which hosts to provision, and you can further configure the play by using `--extra-vars`.

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory --extra-vars='{...}' main.yml

To provision a standalone Varnish box, start the `boxed` VM, which is a Ubuntu 12.04 box:

    $ vagrant up boxed

You will find Varnish listening on the VM's `80` port on address `192.168.33.20` in the private network. You should probably, at minimum, point `varnish_backend` to the `address:port` of a webservice you want to cache.

Run the tests by provisioning the appropriate VM:

    $ vagrant up test-ubuntu-trusty

At the moment, the following test boxes are available:

- `test-ubuntu-precise`
- `test-ubuntu-trusty`


Still to do
-----------
- Provide a simple way to route multiple VCL files
